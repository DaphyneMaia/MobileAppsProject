## Report

In this app I tried to chew more than I could bite and I ended up with nothing. my idea was to have a ADMIN app, so the products could 
be upload there and updated in the costumers app. It actually happens, but the whole app crashes after that. When I try to upload the product
img I cannot because it uploads the cover img, so I cannot actually add the product to the category.
My login page works with firebase, but it is not actually connected with the app.
I have put so much effort to deliver something nice, but my knowledge is not that advanced.
My biggest chalenge is to link everything together and make it work.
I am still working in the app to have a functional FAKE ECCOMERCE WEBSITE and I believe untill the end of the summer I will have it.
After deadline I got some other features working and found some mistakes that I did.
